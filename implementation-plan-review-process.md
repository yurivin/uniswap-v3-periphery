## üîç **PHASE 1: TERMINOLOGY CONSISTENCY**

### **Objective**: Ensure consistent use of names, terms, and concepts throughout the document

### **Areas to Check:**

#### 1.1 Function Names Consistency
```bash
# Search for outdated function names
grep -n "oldFunctionName\|deprecatedName" implementation-plan.md

# Verify current function names are used consistently
grep -n "currentFunctionName" implementation-plan.md
```

**Validation Steps:**
- [ ] All function references use current implementation names
- [ ] No references to deprecated or renamed functions
- [ ] Function names match across code examples, flows, and task descriptions
- [ ] Interface definitions match implementation references

#### 1.2 Contract Names Consistency
```bash
# Check for inconsistent contract naming
grep -n "ContractName\|Contract Name" implementation-plan.md
```

**Validation Steps:**
- [ ] Consistent use of full contract names (e.g., `NonfungiblePositionManager`)
- [ ] Abbreviations used consistently when appropriate
- [ ] No mixing of formal and informal names in technical sections

#### 1.3 Architecture Terminology
**Validation Steps:**
- [ ] Key architectural concepts defined and used consistently
- [ ] Technical terms (e.g., "dynamic lookup", "two-level architecture") used precisely
- [ ] No conflicting terminology for the same concept

#### 1.4 Units and Value Representations
```bash
# Check for inconsistent unit representations
grep -n "basis point\|%\|percentage" implementation-plan.md
```

**Validation Steps:**
- [ ] Fee rates consistently represented (e.g., "0-500 basis points = 0%-5%")

- [ ] Range limits clearly specified and consistent

### **Common Issues to Fix:**
- ‚ùå Old function names in flows but new names in implementation
