# NonfungiblePositionManager Referrer Fee Implementation Plan

## Document Purpose
**This document provides concrete implementation guidance for Position Manager referrer fees.** It contains detailed code examples, step-by-step workflows, implementation components, and development task breakdowns. For technical feasibility analysis and architectural reasoning, see `position-manager-referrer-fee-analysis.md`.

**Target Audience**: Developers implementing the feature, code reviewers, and development teams
**Scope**: Code implementation, workflows, task planning, deployment guidance  
**Companion Document**: `position-manager-referrer-fee-analysis.md` (technical analysis)

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for adding referrer fee functionality to Uniswap V3 NonfungiblePositionManager contracts. The system allows multiple independent NonfungiblePositionManager contract deployments to earn referrer fees from positions they create. Referrer fees are extracted during swap fee calculations (like protocol fees) and provide economic incentives for position management services.

## Recent Updates
**Architecture Updated** (Pool-based Storage with Gas-Limited Capture):
- ✅ **Architecture Change**: Moved from "dynamic lookup" to "Pool-based storage with gas-limited capture"
- ✅ **Security Enhancement**: Gas-limited external calls (5000 gas) with try/catch protection during mint() and fee collection
- ✅ **PositionManager Implementation**: Added `getReferrerFeeRate()` function for dedicated Pool calls
- ✅ **Documentation Updated**: Tests section reflects Pool-based storage approach with gas limits
- ✅ **Current Tests**: `test/PositionManagerReferrerUpdated.spec.ts` with 42 test cases matching current implementation
- ❌ **Old Test Files**: `test/PositionManagerReferrer.spec.ts` and `test/PositionManagerReferrer.simple.spec.ts` use outdated dynamic lookup approach
- ❌ **Pool Implementation**: Pending Pool contract modifications for referrerFeeRate storage in position structure

## Terminology

- **Position Manager**: A deployed NonfungiblePositionManager contract address (not an EOA)
- **Original Position Manager**: The specific NonfungiblePositionManager contract that created a position
- **Referrer**: The address configured to receive referrer fees (can be EOA or contract)
- **Position Owner**: The user who owns the NFT position token
- **Multi-Contract Architecture**: Multiple NonfungiblePositionManager contracts can operate independently with different referrer configurations

## Architecture Summary

### Core Components
1. **Multi-Contract Architecture**: Multiple independent NonfungiblePositionManager contracts can operate with different referrer configurations
2. **Pool-Based Position Storage**: Pool stores referrerFeeRate in its position structure for secure fee calculations
3. **Gas-Limited External Calls**: Pool calls PositionManager.getReferrerFeeRate() with gas limits for security
4. **Position Creation Capture**: Pool captures referrer config during mint() as first action and stores permanently
5. **Contract-Level Management**: Each PositionManager only manages positions it created
6. **Owner-Controlled Configuration**: Only contract owner can modify referrer settings
7. **Locked-In Rates**: Referrer config captured once during position creation and never changes
8. **Unchanged LP Flow**: `collect()` function remains completely unchanged for position owners

### Key Features
- **Multi-Contract Support**: Multiple NonfungiblePositionManager contracts operate independently
- **Pool-Local Storage**: Pool stores referrerFeeRate directly in position structure for immediate access during fee calculations
- **Gas-Limited Security**: Pool calls PositionManager.getReferrerFeeRate() with 5000 gas limit and try/catch protection
- **One-Time Capture**: Referrer fee rate captured during mint() and stored permanently in Pool position data
- **No External Calls During Swaps**: All fee calculations use locally stored data, eliminating security risks
- **Specific Function Call**: Pool uses dedicated getReferrerFeeRate() function instead of full getReferrerConfig()
- **Position Fee Integration**: Referrer fees extracted during existing position fee calculations using stored rates
- **Direct Collection**: NonfungiblePositionManager contracts collect from pools like `collectProtocol()`
- **Contract Authorization**: Only the original NonfungiblePositionManager contract can modify positions it created
- **Cross-Contract Security**: Prevents unauthorized access between different contract deployments
- **Unchanged collect() Function**: Position owners collect LP fees normally, completely unchanged
- **Gas Efficient**: Single external call during position creation, no ongoing external calls
- **Backwards Compatible**: Existing positions work unchanged, new positions store referrer rates

## Implementation Approach

### Function Modification Strategy

**Update Pool Core Functions:**
- `mint()` - Add referrerFeeRate capture as first action using gas-limited external call
- Pool Position struct - Add uint24 referrerFeeRate field to store fee rate per position
- `positions()` - Return referrerFeeRate as part of position data for queries
- `_updatePosition()` - Use stored referrerFeeRate for fee calculations during swaps

**Update PositionManager Functions:**
- `getReferrerFeeRate()` - New dedicated function for Pool to call (gas efficient)
- Configuration functions (`setReferrer()`, `setReferrerFeeRate()`, etc.) - Existing functionality

**Create New Pool Functions:**
- `collectPositionManagerFee()` - New functionality for position managers to collect fees from pools

**Keep Unchanged:**
- `collect()` - Existing position owner fee collection remains completely unchanged
- All other existing LP functionality stays identical

### Key Principles:
1. **Pool-based storage** - Store referrerFeeRate in Pool position structure for secure access during fee calculations
2. **Gas-limited external calls** - Use try/catch with 5000 gas limit when calling PositionManager.getReferrerFeeRate()
3. **One-time capture** - Capture referrer fee rate during mint() and store permanently
4. **No external calls during swaps** - All fee calculations use locally stored data
5. **Preserve existing behavior** - LP functions work exactly as before

## Complete User Flow Documentation

**Key Definitions:**
- **Position Manager** = NonfungiblePositionManager contract address (not EOA)
- **Original Position Manager** = The specific NonfungiblePositionManager contract that created the position
- **Authorization** = Pool verifies operations come through the original NonfungiblePositionManager contract

The position manager referrer fee system involves 9 key user flows:

### **Flow 1: NonfungiblePositionManager Configuration**
```
1. Admin/Owner calls setReferrer(referrerAddress) → NonfungiblePositionManager contract
2. Admin/Owner calls setReferrerFeeRate(feeRate) → NonfungiblePositionManager contract
3. Configuration stored in NonfungiblePositionManager contract storage
4. This configuration applies to ALL positions created through this specific contract
5. Emit ReferrerChanged and ReferrerFeeRateChanged events
```

### **Flow 2: Position Creation through NonfungiblePositionManager**
```
1. User calls mint(params) → NonfungiblePositionManager contract (periphery)
2. NonfungiblePositionManager calls pool.mint() → UniswapV3Pool (core)
3. Pool.mint() FIRST ACTION: Capture referrer fee rate from calling PositionManager
   - Pool calls: try msg.sender.getReferrerFeeRate{gas: 5000}() returns (uint24 feeRate)
   - Gas-limited call with try/catch protection for security
4. Pool stores referrerFeeRate in position structure:
   positions[positionKey] = Position({
     // ... standard fields ...
     referrerFeeRate: feeRate  // Captured from PositionManager
   })
5. Pool continues with standard mint() logic (liquidity calculations, etc.)
6. NonfungiblePositionManager creates position in its own storage (standard Position struct)
7. Position created with referrerFeeRate permanently stored in Pool
8. Emit IncreaseLiquidity event (standard)
```

### **Flow 3: Position Updates through Original NonfungiblePositionManager**
```
1. User calls increaseLiquidity(params) or decreaseLiquidity(params) → NonfungiblePositionManager  
2. NonfungiblePositionManager loads position data (standard Uniswap position struct)
3. NonfungiblePositionManager calls pool operation → UniswapV3Pool
4. Pool checks authorization: require(positions[positionKey].positionManager == msg.sender)
   - Only the original NonfungiblePositionManager contract can modify positions it created
5. Pool calls _updatePosition() internally (standard Uniswap V3 flow)
6. _updatePosition() uses stored referrerFeeRate from position structure (NO external calls)
   - position.referrerFeeRate was stored during initial mint() call
7. _updatePosition() extracts referrer fees if position.referrerFeeRate > 0
8. Referrer fees accumulated in pool storage per PositionManager
9. Position updated with latest fee calculations using stored rate
```

### **Flow 4: Referrer Fee Calculation & Storage (During Any Swap)**
```
1. User performs swap → UniswapV3Pool.swap()
2. Swap triggers fee calculations and position updates  
3. For each affected position: _updatePosition() called internally
4. _updatePosition() reads stored referrerFeeRate from position structure (NO external calls)
5. IF position.referrerFeeRate > 0:
   a. Calculate referrer fees using stored rate: (totalFees * referrerFeeRate) / 10000
   b. Accumulate in positionManagerFees[position.positionManager] 
   c. Position gets remaining fees: position.tokensOwed += (totalFees - referrerFees)
6. All calculations use locally stored data - no external calls during swaps
7. Fees accumulated per original NonfungiblePositionManager contract address
```

### **Flow 5: NonfungiblePositionManager Fee Withdrawal**
```
1. Admin/Owner calls NonfungiblePositionManager.collectFeesFromPool(poolAddress) → NonfungiblePositionManager (periphery)
2. NonfungiblePositionManager verifies caller is contract owner (onlyOwner modifier)
3. NonfungiblePositionManager calls pool.collectPositionManagerFee() → UniswapV3Pool (core)
   - msg.sender = NonfungiblePositionManager contract address
4. Pool identifies caller as NonfungiblePositionManager contract (msg.sender)
5. Pool calls INonfungiblePositionManager(msg.sender).getReferrerConfig() with gas limits and try/catch:
   - try msg.sender.getReferrerConfig{gas: 5000}() returns (address referrer, uint24)
   - If external call fails, return (0, 0) - no fee collection without valid referrer  
6. Pool gets current referrer address from the NonfungiblePositionManager contract
7. require(referrer != address(0), "No referrer configured")
8. Pool reads accumulated fees: positionManagerFees[msg.sender]
9. Pool transfers accumulated fees directly to referrer:
   a. IF token0 amount > 0: transfer token0 to referrer, clear storage
   b. IF token1 amount > 0: transfer token1 to referrer, clear storage
10. Pool clears accumulated fees for this NonfungiblePositionManager contract
11. Pool returns (amount0, amount1) to NonfungiblePositionManager
12. NonfungiblePositionManager returns (amount0, amount1) to admin
13. Emit CollectPositionManagerFee(nftManagerAddress, referrer, amount0, amount1)
```

**Key Points for Fee Withdrawal:**
- Admin/Owner calls NonfungiblePositionManager, which then calls pool
- Admin cannot call pool directly (requires msg.sender == NonfungiblePositionManager contract)
- Fees go directly to the referrer configured in that NonfungiblePositionManager
- Admin triggers collection but never receives fees directly
- Each NonfungiblePositionManager contract has its own referrer and fee accumulation
- Multiple NonfungiblePositionManager contracts can operate independently
- Admin must call collectFeesFromPool() on each pool separately for multi-pool collection

### **Flow 6: Position Deletion through Original NonfungiblePositionManager**
```
1. User calls burn(tokenId) → NonfungiblePositionManager contract
2. NonfungiblePositionManager calls pool.burn() → UniswapV3Pool
3. Pool checks: require(positions[positionKey].positionManager == msg.sender)
   - Only the original NonfungiblePositionManager contract can burn the position
4. Core pool calls _updatePosition() for final fee extraction
5. Final referrer fees calculated and stored for the NonfungiblePositionManager contract
6. Position data cleared from pool
7. NonfungiblePositionManager can later withdraw accumulated fees
```

### **Flow 7: Swap Fee Calculations (Core Logic)**
```
1. Trader performs swap → Pool.swap() function called
2. Pool generates fees and distributes to positions via _updatePosition()
3. _updatePosition() reads stored referrerFeeRate from position structure:
   position = positions[positionKey]
   uint24 referrerFeeRate = position.referrerFeeRate  // No external calls!
4. If referrerFeeRate > 0: Calculate referrer fee portion
   referrerFee0 = (totalFees0 * referrerFeeRate) / 10000
   referrerFee1 = (totalFees1 * referrerFeeRate) / 10000
5. Accumulate referrer fees for the position's original NonfungiblePositionManager:
   positionManagerFees[position.positionManager][token0] += referrerFee0
   positionManagerFees[position.positionManager][token1] += referrerFee1
6. Position receives remaining fees: position.tokensOwed0 += (totalFees0 - referrerFee0)
7. All calculations use locally stored data - no external calls during swaps
```

### **Flow 8: Position Owner Fee Collection (Unchanged)**
```
1. Position Owner calls collect(params) → NonfungiblePositionManager contract
2. NonfungiblePositionManager calls pool.collect() → UniswapV3Pool
3. Pool returns LP fees (already reduced by referrer fees during swaps)
4. Position owner receives remaining fees after referrer extraction
5. NO changes to existing collect() flow - completely backwards compatible
```

### **Flow 9: Contract Authorization Flow**
```
1. Any position modification function called on pool
2. Pool checks: require(positions[positionKey].positionManager == msg.sender)
3. Only the original NonfungiblePositionManager contract that created position can modify it
4. Other NonfungiblePositionManager contracts blocked from modifying positions they didn't create
5. This prevents cross-contract unauthorized access
```

## Pool Implementation Example

### **Enhanced Pool Position Structure**
```solidity
// Enhanced position structure including referrer fee rate
struct PositionInfo {
    uint128 liquidity;
    uint256 feeGrowthInside0LastX128;
    uint256 feeGrowthInside1LastX128;
    uint128 tokensOwed0;
    uint128 tokensOwed1;
    uint24 referrerFeeRate;        // NEW: Stored referrer fee rate
    address positionManager;       // NEW: Original position manager address
}

// Override the positions mapping with enhanced structure
mapping(bytes32 => PositionInfo) public override positions;

// Track accumulated fees per position manager
mapping(address => uint128) public positionManagerFees0;
mapping(address => uint128) public positionManagerFees1;
```

### **Gas-Limited Referrer Fee Rate Capture**
```solidity
function mint(
    address recipient,
    int24 tickLower,
    int24 tickUpper,
    uint128 amount,
    bytes calldata data
) external override returns (uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1) {
    // FIRST ACTION: Capture referrer fee rate with gas-limited call
    uint24 referrerFeeRate = 0;
    address positionManager = msg.sender;
    
    // Gas-limited external call with try/catch for security
    try INonfungiblePositionManager(positionManager).getReferrerFeeRate{gas: 5000}() 
        returns (uint24 feeRate) {
        // Validate fee rate is within acceptable bounds (0-10%)
        if (feeRate <= 1000) {
            referrerFeeRate = feeRate;
        }
    } catch {
        // If call fails, referrerFeeRate remains 0 (no referrer fees)
    }

    // Get position key
    bytes32 positionKey = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, tickLower, tickUpper));
    
    // Store or update position with referrer fee rate
    PositionInfo storage position = positions[positionKey];
    
    // If this is a new position, store the position manager and referrer fee rate
    if (position.liquidity == 0) {
        position.positionManager = positionManager;
        position.referrerFeeRate = referrerFeeRate;
    }

    // Continue with standard mint logic...
    return _mint(recipient, tickLower, tickUpper, amount, data);
}
```

### **Fee Distribution During Swaps**
```solidity
/// @notice Internal function to distribute fees including referrer fees
/// @dev This would be called during _updatePosition() to handle fee distribution
function _distributeFeesWithReferrer(
    bytes32 positionKey,
    uint256 fees0,
    uint256 fees1
) internal {
    PositionInfo storage position = positions[positionKey];
    
    if (position.referrerFeeRate > 0) {
        // Calculate referrer fees using stored rate (no external calls!)
        uint128 referrerFees0 = uint128((fees0 * position.referrerFeeRate) / 10000);
        uint128 referrerFees1 = uint128((fees1 * position.referrerFeeRate) / 10000);
        
        // Accumulate referrer fees for the position manager
        positionManagerFees0[position.positionManager] += referrerFees0;
        positionManagerFees1[position.positionManager] += referrerFees1;
        
        // Position gets remaining fees
        position.tokensOwed0 += uint128(fees0 - referrerFees0);
        position.tokensOwed1 += uint128(fees1 - referrerFees1);
    } else {
        // No referrer fees, position gets all fees
        position.tokensOwed0 += uint128(fees0);
        position.tokensOwed1 += uint128(fees1);
    }
}
```

### **Position Manager Fee Collection**
```solidity
function collectPositionManagerFee(
    address recipient,
    uint128 amount0Requested,
    uint128 amount1Requested
) external override returns (uint128 amount0, uint128 amount1) {
    // Only allow the position manager that earned the fees to collect them
    address positionManager = msg.sender;
    
    // Get current referrer address with gas-limited call for security
    address referrerAddress = address(0);
    try INonfungiblePositionManager(positionManager).getReferrerConfig{gas: 5000}() 
        returns (address referrer, uint24) {
        referrerAddress = referrer;
    } catch {
        // If call fails, no fee collection (referrer required for collection)
        return (0, 0);
    }
    
    // Require valid referrer for fee collection
    require(referrerAddress != address(0), "No referrer configured");
    
    // Get accumulated fees for this position manager
    uint128 fees0 = positionManagerFees0[positionManager];
    uint128 fees1 = positionManagerFees1[positionManager];
    
    // Calculate actual amounts to collect
    amount0 = amount0Requested > fees0 ? fees0 : amount0Requested;
    amount1 = amount1Requested > fees1 ? fees1 : amount1Requested;
    
    // Update accumulated fees
    if (amount0 > 0) {
        positionManagerFees0[positionManager] = fees0 - amount0;
        // Transfer token0 to referrer address
    }
    if (amount1 > 0) {
        positionManagerFees1[positionManager] = fees1 - amount1;
        // Transfer token1 to referrer address
    }
    
    emit CollectPositionManagerFee(positionManager, referrerAddress, amount0, amount1);
}
```

### **Enhanced positions() Function**
```solidity
function positions(bytes32 key)
    external
    view
    override
    returns (
        uint128 _liquidity,
        uint256 feeGrowthInside0LastX128,
        uint256 feeGrowthInside1LastX128,
        uint128 tokensOwed0,
        uint128 tokensOwed1,
        uint24 referrerFeeRate
    )
{
    PositionInfo storage position = positions[key];
    return (
        position.liquidity,
        position.feeGrowthInside0LastX128,
        position.feeGrowthInside1LastX128,
        position.tokensOwed0,
        position.tokensOwed1,
        position.referrerFeeRate
    );
}
```

## Security Features

### **Gas Limit Protection**
- External call to `getReferrerFeeRate()` during mint() limited to 5000 gas
- External call to `getReferrerConfig()` during fee collection limited to 5000 gas
- Prevents gas griefing attacks from malicious PositionManager contracts
- Try/catch ensures pool operations never fail due to external call issues

### **Fee Rate Validation**
- Maximum referrer fee rate capped at 1000 basis points (10%)
- Invalid rates default to 0 (no referrer fees)
- Prevents excessive fee extraction

### **Authorization Control**
- Only original PositionManager can collect fees it earned
- Position manager address stored permanently with position
- Cross-contract access prevention

### **Flow 9: Cross-Contract Communication Flow**
```
1. Pool needs referrer address for fee collection
2. Pool calls the NonfungiblePositionManager contract that's calling it:
   INonfungiblePositionManager(msg.sender).getReferrerConfig()
3. NonfungiblePositionManager returns its configured referrer address
4. Pool transfers fees directly to that referrer
5. Each NonfungiblePositionManager contract manages its own referrer configuration
```

**Multi-Contract Architecture:**
- Multiple NonfungiblePositionManager contracts can exist
- Each has its own referrer configuration and fee accumulation
- Pool tracks which NonfungiblePositionManager created each position
- Only original NonfungiblePositionManager can modify/delete positions it created

## Implementation Components

### 1. Two-Level Storage Architecture

#### A. PositionManager Level (Periphery) - Position Struct Unchanged

```solidity
// PositionManager Position struct remains unchanged from original Uniswap V3
struct Position {
    uint96 nonce;
    address operator;
    uint80 poolId;
    int24 tickLower;
    int24 tickUpper;
    uint128 liquidity;
    uint256 feeGrowthInside0LastX128;
    uint256 feeGrowthInside1LastX128;
    uint128 tokensOwed0;
    uint128 tokensOwed1;
    // NO referrer-specific fields added - referrer config retrieved dynamically
}
```

#### B. Pool Level (Core) - Enhanced Position Storage Required

```solidity
// Pool position storage (in uniswap-v3-core) needs enhancement
struct Position {
    uint128 liquidity;
    uint256 feeGrowthInside0LastX128;
    uint256 feeGrowthInside1LastX128;
    uint128 tokensOwed0;
    uint128 tokensOwed1;
    address positionManager;  // NEW: Track which PositionManager created this position
    // NOTE: referrerFeeRate stored in Pool position structure during mint()
}
```

**Key Architecture Points:**
- **PositionManager**: Stores referrer config, Position struct unchanged
- **Pool**: Stores `referrerFeeRate` and `positionManager` address per position for secure fee calculations
- **One-Time Capture**: Pool calls `positionManager.getReferrerFeeRate()` during mint() with gas limits
- **Stored Rate Usage**: Pool uses stored `referrerFeeRate` for all fee calculations (no external calls during swaps)
- **Dynamic Address Lookup**: Pool calls `positionManager.getReferrerConfig()` only for fee collection recipient

### 2. Position Manager Self-Contained Configuration

```solidity
// Self-contained referrer configuration per PositionManager contract
address public referrer;           // This contract's referrer address  
uint24 public referrerFeeRate;     // This contract's fee rate (0-10000 basis points = 0%-100%)

/// @notice Set referrer address for this PositionManager contract
/// @dev Only callable by contract owner. Affects ALL positions from this contract.
/// @param _referrer Address to receive referrer fees
function setReferrer(address _referrer) external onlyOwner {
    address oldReferrer = referrer;
    referrer = _referrer;
    emit ReferrerChanged(oldReferrer, _referrer);
}

/// @notice Set referrer fee rate for this PositionManager contract  
/// @dev Only callable by contract owner. Applies to ALL positions from this contract.
/// @param _feeRate Fee rate in basis points (0-10000 = 0%-100%)
function setReferrerFeeRate(uint24 _feeRate) external onlyOwner {
    require(_feeRate <= 10000, 'Fee rate too high'); // Max 100%
    uint24 oldFeeRate = referrerFeeRate;
    referrerFeeRate = _feeRate;
    emit ReferrerFeeRateChanged(oldFeeRate, _feeRate);
}

/// @notice Collect accumulated referrer fees from a specific pool
/// @dev Only callable by contract owner/admin. Fees sent directly to configured referrer.
/// @param poolAddress The pool to collect fees from
/// @return amount0 Amount of token0 collected and sent to referrer
/// @return amount1 Amount of token1 collected and sent to referrer  
function collectFeesFromPool(address poolAddress) 
    external 
    onlyOwner 
    returns (uint128 amount0, uint128 amount1)
{
    // Call pool to collect fees - pool will send directly to our configured referrer
    return IUniswapV3Pool(poolAddress).collectPositionManagerFee();
}

/// @notice Collect accumulated referrer fees from multiple pools
/// @dev Only callable by contract owner/admin. Fees sent directly to configured referrer.
/// @param poolAddresses Array of pools to collect fees from
/// @return amounts0 Array of token0 amounts collected per pool
/// @return amounts1 Array of token1 amounts collected per pool
function collectFeesFromPools(address[] calldata poolAddresses)
    external
    onlyOwner
    returns (uint128[] memory amounts0, uint128[] memory amounts1)
{
    amounts0 = new uint128[](poolAddresses.length);
    amounts1 = new uint128[](poolAddresses.length);
    
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < poolAddresses.length; i++) {
        (amounts0[i], amounts1[i]) = IUniswapV3Pool(poolAddresses[i]).collectPositionManagerFee();
    }
}

/// @notice Get referrer configuration for this NonfungiblePositionManager contract
/// @dev Can be called by anyone, typically used by pools to get referrer info
/// @return referrerAddress Referrer address configured for this contract
/// @return feeRate Fee rate in basis points configured for this contract
function getReferrerConfig() 
    external 
    view 
    returns (address referrerAddress, uint24 feeRate);
```

### 3. Hybrid Fee Storage and Calculation

```solidity
// In UniswapV3Pool.sol - Storage like protocol fees, multiple managers per pool
struct PositionManagerFees {
    uint128 token0;
    uint128 token1;
}

mapping(address => PositionManagerFees) public positionManagerFees;

// Fee extraction integrated into existing position fee calculations
// No separate extraction functions - calculated where position fees are calculated
// Position managers collect directly from pools (like collectProtocol)
```

### 4. Pool Fee Collection Function

```solidity
// In UniswapV3Pool.sol - Position managers collect directly from pools
/// @notice Collect accumulated referrer fees for position manager
/// @return amount0 Token0 amount collected
/// @return amount1 Token1 amount collected
function collectPositionManagerFee()
    external
    returns (uint128 amount0, uint128 amount1) {
    address positionManager = msg.sender;
    
    amount0 = positionManagerFees[positionManager].token0;
    amount1 = positionManagerFees[positionManager].token1;
    
    // Get referrer address from periphery
    (address referrer, ) = INonfungiblePositionManager(positionManager).getReferrerConfig();
    require(referrer != address(0), "No referrer configured");
    
    if (amount0 > 0) {
        positionManagerFees[positionManager].token0 = 0;
        TransferHelper.safeTransfer(token0, referrer, amount0);
    }
    
    if (amount1 > 0) {
        positionManagerFees[positionManager].token1 = 0;
        TransferHelper.safeTransfer(token1, referrer, amount1);
    }
    
    emit CollectPositionManagerFee(positionManager, referrer, amount0, amount1);
}

/// @notice Get accumulated fees for calling position manager
/// @return amount0 Token0 accumulated amount
/// @return amount1 Token1 accumulated amount
function getPositionManagerFee()
    external
    view
    returns (uint128 amount0, uint128 amount1) {
    address positionManager = msg.sender;
    return (positionManagerFees[positionManager].token0, positionManagerFees[positionManager].token1);
}
```

### 5. PositionManager Mint Function (No Changes Required)

```solidity
// PositionManager mint() function remains UNCHANGED in two-level architecture
// The existing mint() function continues to work exactly as before
// NO modifications needed to PositionManager Position struct
// Pool-level position tracking will be handled in core contracts during pool.mint() calls

/// @inheritdoc INonfungiblePositionManager  
function mint(MintParams calldata params)
    external
    payable
    override
    checkDeadline(params.deadline)
    returns (uint256 tokenId, uint128 liquidity, uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1)
{
    // Existing mint logic remains completely unchanged
    // PositionManager Position struct: NO referrer fields added
    // Pool integration will be handled at the pool level
}

### 6. Pool Contract Integration (Modify Existing _updatePosition)

Fee extraction integrated into existing position fee calculations by modifying `_updatePosition()` in place:

```solidity
// In UniswapV3Pool.sol - integrated into existing _updatePosition() function
function _updatePosition(
    address owner,
    int24 tickLower,
    int24 tickUpper,
    int128 liquidityDelta,
    int256 feeGrowthInside0X128,
    int256 feeGrowthInside1X128
) private returns (bytes32 positionKey) {
    Position.Info storage _self = positions[positionKey];
    
    // Existing position fee calculations...
    uint256 tokensOwed0 = FullMath.mulDiv(
        feeGrowthInside0X128 - _self.feeGrowthInside0LastX128,
        _self.liquidity,
        FixedPoint128.Q128
    );
    uint256 tokensOwed1 = FullMath.mulDiv(
        feeGrowthInside1X128 - _self.feeGrowthInside1LastX128,
        _self.liquidity,
        FixedPoint128.Q128
    );
    
    // NEW: Extract position manager referrer fees during position fee calculation
    if (_self.positionManager != address(0)) {
        // Dynamic lookup: Get current referrer config from PositionManager
        (address referrer, uint24 feeRate) = INonfungiblePositionManager(_self.positionManager).getReferrerConfig();
        
        if (referrer != address(0) && feeRate > 0) {
            uint256 referrerFee0 = (tokensOwed0 * feeRate) / 10000;
            uint256 referrerFee1 = (tokensOwed1 * feeRate) / 10000;
        
            // Accumulate in pool storage (like protocol fees)
            positionManagerFees[_self.positionManager].token0 += referrerFee0;
            positionManagerFees[_self.positionManager].token1 += referrerFee1;
            
            // Reduce position owner fees
            tokensOwed0 -= referrerFee0;
            tokensOwed1 -= referrerFee1;
        }
    }
    
    // Existing logic continues with adjusted tokensOwed amounts...
    _self.tokensOwed0 += tokensOwed0;
    _self.tokensOwed1 += tokensOwed1;
}
```

## Events

```solidity
event PositionCreated(
    uint256 indexed tokenId,
    address indexed positionManager,
    uint24 referrerFeeRate
);

event PositionManagerReferrerSet(
    address indexed positionManager,
    address indexed referrer
);

event PositionManagerFeeRateSet(
    address indexed positionManager,
    uint24 feeRate
);

event PositionManagerFeeCollected(
    address indexed positionManager,
    address indexed token,
    uint256 amount
);

event PositionManagerFeeCollectedMultiple(
    address indexed positionManager,
    address[] tokens,
    uint256[] amounts
);
```

### **Cross-Contract Tasks (15-16)**
- **Repository**: Both repositories
- **Focus**: Integration testing, security audit

## Pool-Based Storage Architecture (Current Implementation)

### Core Principle: Pool-Based Storage with Gas-Limited Capture

#### 1. Position Manager Self-Contained Configuration (IMPLEMENTED)
```solidity
// In NonfungiblePositionManager.sol - Instance Variables per Contract
address public referrer;           // This contract's referrer address  
uint24 public referrerFeeRate;     // This contract's fee rate (0-10000 basis points = 0%-100%)

function setReferrer(address _referrer) external onlyOwner {
    address oldReferrer = referrer;
    referrer = _referrer;
    emit ReferrerChanged(oldReferrer, _referrer);
}

function setReferrerFeeRate(uint24 _feeRate) external onlyOwner {
    require(_feeRate <= 10000, 'Fee rate too high'); // Max 100%
    uint24 oldFeeRate = referrerFeeRate;
    referrerFeeRate = _feeRate;
    emit ReferrerFeeRateChanged(oldFeeRate, _feeRate);
}

function getReferrerConfig() external view returns (address referrerAddress, uint24 feeRate) {
    return (referrer, referrerFeeRate);
}

function getReferrerFeeRate() external view returns (uint24 feeRate) {
    return referrerFeeRate;
}
```

#### 2. Pool-Based Storage During Position Creation (PENDING IMPLEMENTATION)
```solidity
// In UniswapV3Pool.sol - Pool stores referrerFeeRate in position structure
function mint(address recipient, int24 tickLower, int24 tickUpper, uint128 amount, bytes calldata data)
    external
    returns (uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1)
{
    // FIRST ACTION: Capture referrer fee rate with gas-limited external call
    uint24 referrerFeeRate = 0;
    try INonfungiblePositionManager(msg.sender).getReferrerFeeRate{gas: 5000}() 
        returns (uint24 rate) {
        referrerFeeRate = rate;
    } catch {
        // Continue with rate = 0 if external call fails
        referrerFeeRate = 0;
    }
    
    // Standard Uniswap V3 mint logic...
    
    // NEW: Store referrerFeeRate in position structure permanently
    bytes32 positionKey = PositionKey.compute(recipient, tickLower, tickUpper);
    positions[positionKey].referrerFeeRate = referrerFeeRate; // Stored once, used forever
    emit PositionMinted(msg.sender, recipient, tickLower, tickUpper, amount);
}
```

**Key Points:**
- ✅ **PositionManager Position struct**: UNCHANGED (maintains backward compatibility)
- 🚧 **Pool Position struct**: Enhanced to track `positionManager` address AND `referrerFeeRate`
- ✅ **One-time capture**: Referrer fee rate captured via `positionManager.getReferrerFeeRate()` during mint()
- ✅ **Stored rate usage**: Fee calculations use stored `referrerFeeRate` (no external calls during swaps)
- ✅ **Dynamic address lookup**: Referrer address retrieved via `positionManager.getReferrerConfig()` for fee collection only

#### 3. Pool Fee Collection (Dynamic Lookup - PENDING IMPLEMENTATION)
```solidity
// In UniswapV3Pool.sol
function collectPositionManagerFee()
    external
    returns (uint128 amount0, uint128 amount1)
{
    address positionManager = msg.sender;
    
    // Dynamic lookup: Get referrer from calling PositionManager
    (address referrer, ) = INonfungiblePositionManager(positionManager).getReferrerConfig();
    require(referrer != address(0), "No referrer configured");
    
    amount0 = positionManagerFees[positionManager].token0;
    amount1 = positionManagerFees[positionManager].token1;
    
    if (amount0 > 0) {
        positionManagerFees[positionManager].token0 = 0;
        TransferHelper.safeTransfer(token0, referrer, amount0);
    }
    if (amount1 > 0) {
        positionManagerFees[positionManager].token1 = 0;
        TransferHelper.safeTransfer(token1, referrer, amount1);
    }
    
    emit CollectPositionManagerFee(positionManager, referrer, amount0, amount1);
}
```

#### 4. Usage Pattern Examples (Current Implementation)
```solidity
// Position Manager A Setup (IMPLEMENTED)
positionManagerA.setReferrer(referrerX);
positionManagerA.setReferrerFeeRate(250); // 2.5% (max 100%)

// Position Manager B Setup (IMPLEMENTED)
positionManagerB.setReferrer(referrerY);
positionManagerB.setReferrerFeeRate(100); // 1.0%

// All positions created by A → dynamically use referrerX and current fee rate
// All positions created by B → dynamically use referrerY and current fee rate

// Fee collection: Admin calls PositionManager A, which calls pool (PENDING)
positionManagerA.collectFeesFromPool(poolAddress);
// → Pool calls positionManagerA.getReferrerConfig() → Fees sent to referrerX

// Fee collection: Admin calls PositionManager B (PENDING)
positionManagerB.collectFeesFromPool(poolAddress);
// → Pool calls positionManagerB.getReferrerConfig() → Fees sent to referrerY
```

### Key Simplifications

#### 1. Configuration Simplicity (IMPLEMENTED)
- **One referrer per NonfungiblePositionManager contract** (not per position)
- **One fee rate per NonfungiblePositionManager contract** (not per position)  
- **Stored fee rates**: Fee rates captured once during mint() and stored in Pool for security
- **Dynamic referrer address**: Current referrer address retrieved via `getReferrerConfig()` for fee collection
- **Contract-level management**: Each contract deployment manages its own configuration
- **Max 100% fee rate**: Allows position managers full control over LP fees

#### 2. Collection Simplicity  
- NonfungiblePositionManager contract calls pool directly
- Pool automatically sends to that contract's configured referrer
- No recipient parameter needed
- No complex routing logic
- Each contract collects its own accumulated fees

#### 3. Storage Efficiency
- Simple instance variables per contract deployment
- Direct public access for pools
- No complex nested structures
- Separate fee accumulation per contract in pools

#### 4. Security Model
- Each NonfungiblePositionManager contract controls its own referrer
- Each contract's referrer receives all fees from positions created by that contract
- No way to redirect fees during collection
- Cross-contract authorization prevents unauthorized modifications
- Contract isolation prevents interference between different deployments

## Gas Optimization Strategies

1. **Storage Packing**: Pack new fields efficiently in Position struct
2. **Batch Operations**: Support batch fee collection for gas efficiency
3. **Existing Patterns**: Leverage existing fee calculation mechanisms
4. **Minimal Overhead**: Only add computation when referrer fees are configured

## Security Considerations

1. **Fee Rate Limits**: Maximum 100% referrer fee rate (10000 basis points)
2. **Self-Management**: Position managers control their own configuration
3. **Immutable Associations**: Position manager cannot be changed after creation
4. **Position Authorization**: Only original position manager can modify positions they created
5. **Reentrancy Protection**: Use existing patterns from collect() function
6. **Access Control**: Proper validation in configuration and position modification functions

## Backwards Compatibility

1. **Existing Positions**: Continue to work without referrer fees (default 0% rate)
2. **Interface Compatibility**: All existing functions maintain same signatures
3. **Optional Features**: Referrer fees are opt-in via position manager configuration
4. **Migration**: Smooth transition for existing position managers

## Success Metrics

1. **Adoption**: Number of position managers implementing referrer fees
2. **Volume**: Value of positions created with referrer fees
3. **Efficiency**: Gas cost impact on position creation and management
4. **Security**: No security incidents or fee calculation errors

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a clean, efficient system for position manager referrer fees that:
- Follows existing Uniswap protocol patterns (protocol fees, SwapRouter referrer fees)
- Maintains backwards compatibility with existing integrations
- Provides economic incentives for position management services
- Minimizes gas overhead and complexity
- Enables self-governance without central control mechanisms

The system is designed to integrate seamlessly with existing Uniswap V3 infrastructure while providing new economic opportunities for position managers and referrers.
